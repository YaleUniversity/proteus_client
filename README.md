# Bluecat Proteus API client

  Simple ruby API client for Proteus.
  Some inspiration drawn from: https://github.com/rjbalest/proteus-ruby-api

## Overview

  This app connects to a Bluecat Proteus server via SOAP API to perform various DNS-related tasks.
  All of the configuration is in config/config.yml that needs to be customized for you particular 
  setup. All you need is the URL, API username/password and the View ID in Proteus. In our case the
  View ID is the id of the default DNS view as that's where everything goes.

## Installation

Add the following to your `Gemfile`

```
gem 'proteus', git: 'https://github.com/YaleUniversity/proteus_client.git'
```

or from the command line:

```
git clone git@github.com:YaleUniversity/proteus_client.git
cd proteus_client &&  gem build proteus.gemspec
gem install proteus-*.gem

```

## Common options

The proteus command line utility can be configured via files, environment variables or flags.  See `proteus help` for details.
